Some codes used in my project. I'll update this when I have enough time to make it more clear and usable.

# usage
Jupyter notebooks used in this project converts ISOT-2010 and CTU-13 files into grayscales and hdf5 to input a ResNet50 model.

The two compressed files contains all the botnet flows transffered into graycales in CTU-13, and all normal flows processed into grayscales in ISOT-2010, which both have mapping from name to label in csv files.
